This is an example introduction. It's written as raw LaTeX, which will be added 
to the document as-is. This is a good place to put acknowledgements,
credits, and other information about the book.

Special thanks to:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Authors} for writing the songs
  \item \textbf{The Artists} for creating the music
  \item \textbf{The Transcribers} for transcribing the songs
  \item \textbf{The Proofreaders} for proofreading the songs
  \item \textbf{The Typesetters} for typesetting the songs

\end{itemize}
Without all of you this book never would have been possible. \\
